If cards i and j are similar in quality, $i|j$ is probably similar to $j|i$ anyways. If they are very different, then the less popular card $i$, if drafted early, won't affect the choice of popular cards, so while $i|j$ would be very different for different $j$, the value of $j|i$ will be similar for all $j$. I think this logic is sound, but it is hard to explain. Maybe it's easier to calculate an asymmetric matrix after all.."
