Statistical Analyses of Magic the Gathering data
========================================

This is a collection of scripts to analyze draft logs from [Draftsim.com](http://draftsim.com) site. The project is supported by a small team of people (Arseny Khakhalin, Bobby Mills, Dan Trocha, Daniel Brooks, and Henry Ward). We are gradually writing up the results of these analyses, as a series of blog posts. As of now, we published 4 posts:

1. [Basic analysis](https://draftsim.com/blog/draft-data-analysis/) - introducing the co-drafting distances, and MDS scaling.
2. [Changes in drafting](https://draftsim.com/blog/m19-format-evolution/) : drafting of the same set early in the season, compared to late  in the season. Also, statistics of color preferences (aka Guilds) among players.
3. [Controversial cards](https://draftsim.com/blog/guilds-of-ravnica-first-look/): cards that are loved by some people, but disliked by others (original idea by Bobby Mills). This analysis turned to be rather fancy, as I ran into a couple of mathematical paradoxes.
4. [Color wheel](https://draftsim.com/blog/ravnica-allegiance-first-look/) for guild-based blocks (GRN and RAN).

Code commentaries:

* Basic analysis in R: [markdown notebook](Arseny/writeup_intro.Rmd), and [the same thing rendered in HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/khakhalin/MTG/blob/master/Arseny/writeup_intro.nb.html) (with ggplot graphs and everything).

To be continued!
